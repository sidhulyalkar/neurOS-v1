"""
NWB writer for neural and physiological timeseries.

This module wraps the ``pynwb`` library to write time series data
conforming to the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) 2.0 standard.  NWB
files provide a rich metadata schema for storing electrophysiology,
optophysiology, behaviour and other experimental data along with
experimental metadata such as subject demographics, device
specifications and acquisition parameters.

The ``write_nwb_file`` function accepts a list of channels or
modalities and writes them into an NWB file along with session and
subject metadata.  For large datasets NWB supports HDF5 chunking and
compression; these options can be tuned via the input parameters.
