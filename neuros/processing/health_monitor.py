"""
Quality monitor for neurOS.

This module defines a simple class for monitoring data quality during
pipeline runs.  The monitor accumulates the mean and standard
deviation of incoming samples over time.  At the end of a run, the
mean of the sample means and the mean of the sample standard
deviations are returned as quality metrics.  These metrics
approximate overall signal amplitude and variability.

The monitor can handle 1D arrays (e.g. EEG or EMG channels), 2D arrays
(e.g. video or calcium imaging frames) and scalar values.  It uses
``numpy`` to compute statistics.
