"""
Federated client for neurOS.

The :class:`FederatedClient` can push run metrics and results to a
central aggregator service in a federated deployment.  In this
placeholder implementation it simply writes metrics and results to a
designated directory, simulating the handoff to an aggregator or
coordinator.  In future versions this class could publish over a
message bus, send HTTP requests or implement secure aggregation
protocols.
