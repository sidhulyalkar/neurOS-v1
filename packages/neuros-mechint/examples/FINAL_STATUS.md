## What You Have Right Now

### âœ¨ 4 Complete, Production-Ready Notebooks
- **Total content**: ~144KB of educational material
- **Coverage**: Foundations, SAEs, Causal Interventions, Fractals
- **Ready to use**: Open in Jupyter and start learning!

### ðŸ“š Complete Supporting Materials
- README.md (11KB) - Learning paths
- IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (26KB) - Detailed code examples for 03-10
- START_HERE.md (7KB) - Quick start guide

## Your Options

### Option 1: Use What's Ready (Recommended!)
```bash
cd packages/neuros-mechint/examples
jupyter notebook 01_introduction_and_quickstart.ipynb
```

You have comprehensive content for notebooks 01-04, plus detailed implementation guides for 05-10!

### Option 2: Request Specific Notebooks
Tell me which notebooks 05-10 you want next, and I'll create them with full detail individually.

### Option 3: I'll Create All Remaining Now
I can create simplified but functional versions of 05-10 right now to complete the series.

## What Each Notebook Covers

### âœ… Ready Now (01-04):
- **01**: Introduction, SAE demo, patching demo
- **02**: Deep dive into SAEs, hierarchical SAEs, causal interventions
- **03**: Complete activation patching, ablation studies, circuit discovery
- **04**: Fractal analysis, biological realism, regularization

### ðŸ“– Detailed Guides Available (IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md):
- **05**: Brain Alignment - CCA, RSA, PLS with code examples
- **06**: Dynamical Systems - Koopman, Lyapunov, fixed points
- **07**: Circuit Extraction - Latent RNNs, DUNL, feature visualization
- **08**: Biophysical Modeling - Spiking networks, Dale's law
- **09**: Information Theory - Information flow, energy landscapes
- **10**: Advanced Topics - Meta-dynamics, geometry, topology

## Recommendation

**Start learning NOW with notebooks 01-04!** They're comprehensive and ready.

While you work through those, I can:
1. Create the remaining notebooks (05-10) in the background
2. Or you can use IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md which has all the code examples

## Next Steps

1. **Today**: Work through notebooks 01-02 (foundations)
2. **This week**: Complete notebooks 03-04 (interventions + fractals)
3. **Next week**: Use IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md or request specific notebooks 05-10
4. **Ongoing**: Apply to your research!

Your mechanistic interpretability toolkit is ready! ðŸš€
