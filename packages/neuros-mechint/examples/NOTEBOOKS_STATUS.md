## Next Steps
1. Run notebooks 01-02 to learn foundations
2. Request specific notebooks 03-10 for detailed implementation
3. Or use the comprehensive README as a guide to explore the library

## Notes
- All notebooks use lightweight models (laptop-friendly)
- Each builds on previous concepts
- Includes visualizations, exercises, and real-world applications
- Connects to neuroscience research and AI safety
