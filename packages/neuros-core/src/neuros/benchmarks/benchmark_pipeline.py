"""
Pipeline benchmark for neurOS.

This module defines a simple benchmark that trains a baseline model on
synthetic data, runs the pipeline with a mock driver and reports
performance metrics.  These include throughput (samples per second), mean
latency (seconds) and classification accuracy on a heldâ€‘out test set.
