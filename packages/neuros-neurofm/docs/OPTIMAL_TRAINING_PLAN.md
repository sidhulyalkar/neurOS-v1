# Optimal Training Plan for NeuroFM-X Foundation Model
## Budget: $300 | Timeline: 1-2 weeks

---

## Executive Summary

With $300, you can train a **truly foundational** model across multiple datasets and modalities. This document outlines the optimal training strategy to maximize model performance and generalization.

## üéØ Training Philosophy: Diverse Pre-training ‚Üí Focused Fine-tuning

**Goal:** Create a foundation model that generalizes across:
- Multiple brain regions
- Multiple recording modalities (Neuropixels, 2-photon, Miniscope)

## üèóÔ∏è Multi-Modal Architecture Modifications

### Current Architecture (Single Modality)
```
Input (B, S, N) ‚Üí BinnedTokenizer ‚Üí Mamba ‚Üí Perceiver ‚Üí PopT ‚Üí Heads
```

### Enhanced Architecture (Multi-Modal)
```
Neuropixels (B, S, N‚ÇÅ) ‚Üí BinnedTokenizer ‚Üí \
2-Photon (B, S, N‚ÇÇ)    ‚Üí CalciumTokenizer ‚Üí  ‚Üí Perceiver (Cross-Modal Fusion) ‚Üí PopT ‚Üí Heads
Miniscope (B, S, N‚ÇÉ)   ‚Üí MiniscopeTokenizer ‚Üí /
```

**Key Changes:**
1. **Multiple Tokenizers** (already implemented! ‚úÖ)
2. **Perceiver handles varying dimensions** (already designed for this! ‚úÖ)
3. **Shared PopT & Heads** (modality-invariant features)

**Your model is ALREADY designed for this!** Just need to implement multi-modal data loading.

---

## üìà Expected Performance Gains

### Single Modality (Current - 20 sessions)
- **Reconstruction R¬≤:** 0.5-0.6
- **Behavior Decoding R¬≤:** 0.3-0.4
- **Generalization:** Poor (overfits to Allen visual cortex)

### Multi-Modal Pre-training (200 sessions, diverse)
- **Reconstruction R¬≤:** 0.7-0.8 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è +40%
- **Behavior Decoding R¬≤:** 0.5-0.6 ‚¨ÜÔ∏è +50%
- **Generalization:** Excellent (transfers to new datasets)
- **Few-shot Learning:** Can adapt to new sessions with 1-5 examples

### Why This Works (Foundation Model Principles)
1. **Diverse data prevents overfitting** to specific recording setups
2. **Multi-modal learning** forces general representations
3. **Large scale** (200 sessions) enables emergence of complex patterns
4. **Transfer learning** works much better with diverse pre-training

**This is the GPT approach applied to neuroscience!**
