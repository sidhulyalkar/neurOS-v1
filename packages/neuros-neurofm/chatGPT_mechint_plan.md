Current state (what you’ve got right now)

From the repo structure and the src tree:

Core modeling

models/neurofmx.py, models/multimodal_neurofmx.py, models/neurofmx_complete.py: single- and multi-modal backbones, with a “complete” wrapper that looks like it orchestrates tokenization → backbone → heads.

tokenizers/ and fusion/ exist (good sign you’ve isolated modality tokenization and fusion).

losses/__init__.py present (custom objectives likely wired already).

Data & integration

datasets/nwb_loader.py: NWB-centric loader—great foundation for scientific rigor and cross-lab compatibility.

integration/neuros_adapter.py: hooks into neurOS plumbing (orchestration/streaming).

Training & evaluation

training/train.py and training/train_multimodal.py: standard training entry points; there’s also train_legacy.py/_legacy_logging.py.

evaluation/evaluate_model.py and evaluation/falcon.py: you’ve started an eval harness and at least one baseline/benchmark routine.

optimization/hyperparameter_search.py: a foothold for sweeps (we’ll upgrade this to Ray Tune).

Interpretability

interpretability/circuit_discovery.py: the first mechanistic-interpretability (Mech-Int) foothold (we’ll extend this into a full suite).

Serving & API

api/server.py: you’ve got the start of an inference server.

Docs & ops

Good markdowns: README_IMPLEMENTATION.md, NEUROFMX_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md, docs/NEUROFM_FOUNDATION_MODEL_PLAN.md, TRAINING_GUIDE*.md, CLOUD_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md, deployment/ and infra/ folders, plus Dockerfiles and examples.

Strengths

Clean modularization: tokenizers, fusion, datasets, training, evaluation, interpretability, and an API layer are separated. That’s exactly how you scale.

NWB loader: locks you into a gold-standard neuro data format that can unify across labs, tasks, and species.

Multimodal backbone: you’ve pre-committed to fused latent spaces—which is crucial for cross-domain generalization.

Early interpretability: circuit discovery exists; we’ll formalize and expand it drastically.

Gaps & high-ROI improvements

Distributed training at scale: Move to Ray + PyTorch FSDP/DeepSpeed ZeRO-3, bf16, activation checkpointing, and fault-tolerant runs.

Unified multimodal datalake: Add scalable sharded formats (WebDataset/tar, Parquet/Zarr) with on-the-fly transforms and lazy loading; cover EEG/ECoG, spikes, LFP, fMRI, behavior/video/pose, eye-tracking, audio, physio (HRV/EDA), and text/task-metadata.

Objectives at scale: Beyond reconstruction/contrastive: masked-token modeling per-modality, cross-modality alignment (InfoNCE/CMC), predictive coding (forecast Δt), denoising diffusion priors for neural segments, and task-conditional adapters.

Evaluation matrix: Formal cross-species, cross-task zero-/few-shot evals; canonical neuro decoding benchmarks (spike→kinematics, EEG→sleep stages/mental state, fMRI→encoding/decoding), behavior forecasting, OOD transfer across labs.

Mechanistic interpretability suite: Turn the initial circuit_discovery.py into a batteries-included toolkit: probes, SAEs, causal tracing, activation patching, subcircuit search, attribution on neural channels, model→brain alignment (CCA/PLS/RSA), and dynamical systems analyses.

Repro & observability: MLflow + Weights & Biases full integration, dataset versioning (DVC/Quilt), lineage, run registries, and automatic reproducibility manifests.

Serve & adapt: A small set of heads/adapters that can quickly specialize to new tasks/species with LoRA/IA³ adapters without retraining the whole backbone.

Safety/ethics & governance: Permissions for sensitive data (clinical), de-identification, and usage gating in deployment.

Cloud training blueprint (multimodal, at-scale, fault-tolerant)
Infra choices

Cluster: Kubernetes (K8s) + Ray on top for orchestration of training/eval/sweeps.

Acceleration: PyTorch 2.x (torch.compile), FSDP (or DeepSpeed ZeRO-3), bf16, gradient checkpointing, Flash-Attention v2 if attention is used anywhere.

Storage:

Object store (S3/GCS/R2) + pre-sharded WebDataset (tar of samples) or Zarr/Parquet for arrays/metadata.

Metadata registry: Postgres/MinIO bucket indexing; DVC or Quilt for dataset snapshots.

Queues & streaming (optional): Kafka or NATS JetStream when training on continuous-live streams (neurOS real-time).

Experiment tracking: MLflow (artifacts to object store) + W&B for rich visualizations.

Hyperparam sweeps: Ray Tune, ASHA/PBT.

Autoscaling: Ray autoscaler on K8s node pools (A100/H100 pools); preemptible support with checkpointing.

Performance controls

Mixed precision (bf16), gradient accumulation targeting global batch sizes that saturate GPUs.

Sharded optimizer state (FSDP), CPU offload if needed.

Efficient dataloader: memory-mapped arrays, cached decoding for videos (Decord/torchvision with pre-extracted features for heavy modalities), pinned memory, prefetch >2× per GPU.

Checkpointing: every N steps + resumable data iterators (store shard index + sample offset).

Shard locality: co-locate WebDataset shards per node to minimize cross-node bandwidth.

Modeling roadmap to “foundation” status
Phase 0 — Hardening & cleanup (1–2 weeks)

Consolidate training entry points into a single CLI with Hydra configs: python -m neuros_neurofm.train +exp=multimodal_foundation

Standardize config schemas (modalities, tokenizers, fusion, objectives, schedulers, logging).

Normalize tensor shapes and timebases across modalities; formal “TokenSpec” (sampling rate, window, hop, channel map, masking rules).

Add strict unit tests for shape contracts and masking logic.

Phase 1 — Data hub & tokenizers (2–4 weeks)

Expand datasets/ beyond NWB: EEG/ECoG, LFP, spikes, fMRI (BOLD), video/pose (DeepLabCut/Facemap), audio/physio, eye-tracking, task meta.

Create tokenizers per modality:

Neural continuous streams → patch/SSM tokens (STFT-style, S4/Mamba-style chunks, or learned filterbanks).

Video → timeslice visual tokens (ViT/TimeSformer features or lightweight encoders).

Pose → sequence of joint-latent tokens.

Text/task → standard BPE with temporal alignment.

Add alignment adapters so any modality can be projected into a shared latent with explicit temporal anchors.

Phase 2 — Backbones & fusion

Offer dual backbone options: Transformer, SSM (Mamba/S5).

Fusion alternatives:

Early fusion (concat + cross-attn),

Mid fusion (co-attn at scheduled blocks),

Late fusion (per-modality encoders + gated product-of-experts in latent).

Regularize for cross-domain: modality dropout, time-masking, channel masking, specAugment-like for neural signals.

Phase 3 — Objectives & curriculum

Self-supervised:

Masked modeling per modality (random temporal masks).

Contrastive: cross-modal alignment (e.g., neural↔video, neural↔text).

Predictive coding: next-segment forecasting Δt=100–1000 ms; multi-horizon.

Denoising: diffusion prior for neural segments (auxiliary).

Supervised heads (optional during pretraining): e.g., spike inference from calcium, sleep stage from EEG, kinematics from ECoG/LFP.

Multi-task curriculum: start unimodal (stabilize), then pairwise fusion, then full multimodal.

Phase 4 — Scaling laws & sweeps

Use Ray Tune ASHA/PBT to sweep: model width/depth, SSM kernel size, learning rate schedule, mixup of objectives, fusion frequency, masking ratios.

Track training loss vs. tokens by domain to establish scaling behavior and data value accounting.

Phase 5 — Mechanistic interpretability (full suite)

Extend interpretability/ from a single circuit_discovery.py into a package:

Probing: linear/nonlinear probes (logistic/MLP/CKA) predicting: stimulus features, behavioral latent, cell-type labels (if available), or brain region.

Activation patching (causal tracing): replace latent segments from one sample with another; measure effect on outputs and on neuro alignment.

Causal ablations: mask attention heads/SSM blocks/channels; “knock-out” experiments with automatic report.

Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) on hidden states to discover features; visualize feature dictionaries over time.

Model-to-brain alignment: CCA/PLS/RSA between model latents and recorded neural activity; noise-ceiling corrected metrics.

Dynamical systems: estimate Koopman operators, controllability/observability proxies, Lyapunov exponents on latent trajectories; identify slow manifolds.

Circuit search: graph-based subnetwork mining for features with high causal score for specific outputs/brain regions/modalities.

Attribution: integrated gradients/DeepLIFT on input channels (neural electrodes, brain areas, video patches).

Cross-domain feature matching: identify shared features that transfer across species/tasks; rank them by causal/evidence score.

Phase 6 — Evaluation suite (generalization as a first-class metric)

Zero-shot / Few-shot across: species (mouse→non-human primate→human), tasks (Go/No-Go → PRL → DD), labs, recording tech (ECoG↔EEG↔LFP↔spikes), and behaviors (reach/locomotion/eye).

Canonical decoding benchmarks:

ECoG/EEG → speech/phoneme/syllable decoding, sleep stage;

Spikes/LFP → reach velocity/EMG;

fMRI → image/semantic encoding & decoding;

Video/Pose → behavior state classification and forecasting.

Report cards: aggregate transfer matrices and gap-to-supervised headroom.

Phase 7 — Serving & adapters

Convert api/server.py to a typed FastAPI with:

/embed (per modality, batched), /align (cross-modal), /decode (with task head), /interpret (run a chosen Mech-Int routine).

Adapters: LoRA/IA³ fine-tuning heads for rapid domain specialization without touching the backbone.

Phase 8 — Governance, privacy, safety

Consent/IRB metadata binding, PHI scrubbing, de-identification utilities (face/voice blurring in video/audio), access control in API.

Immediate code-level upgrades (target the files you already have)

datasets/nwb_loader.py:

Add shard writers (WebDataset) + iterable dataset that resumes mid-shard with a saved cursor.

Time alignment utility that emits (tokens, t0, dt, mask) for each modality.

models/*neurofmx*.py:

Implement modular FusionBlock with a registry (early|mid|late|poe), and a schedule: e.g., fuse at layers [L/4, L/2, 3L/4].

Ensure hooks for recording hidden states at arbitrary layers (for Mech-Int).

training/train*.py:

Consolidate into one CLI with Hydra; add FSDP config and checkpointing policy; plug Ray Train for distributed runs.

Integrate MLflow + W&B (run, artifacts, system metrics).

evaluation/*:

Build eval_tasks.yaml → auto-runs a grid of tasks; produce a transfer matrix heatmap artifact per run.

interpretability/circuit_discovery.py:

Factor into a package: probes.py, patching.py, sae.py, alignment.py, dynamics.py, circuits.py, attribution.py.

Add tests with tiny synthetic datasets where causal structure is known.

Concrete cloud recipe (drop-in)

Images: One base Docker image for training (PyTorch 2.x, CUDA, flash-attn, mamba-ssm if used with NumPy 2-compatible wheels).

K8s: A Ray head + worker template (node selector for A100/H100), GPU resource requests/limits, host-path cache for shard locality.

Ray: ray_cluster.yaml with autoscaler; ray_trainer.py wrapping your unified train.py.

Storage: S3 bucket structure
s3://neurofmx/
    shards/{modality}/{split}/neurofmx-{000000..}.tar
    metadata/datasets.json
    runs/{YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS}/
    mlflow/

Data registry: a simple JSON or Quilt catalog with dataset IDs, splits, licenses, species, tasks.

Mechanistic interpretability expansions (new features to build now)

Linear probes on every block output (per modality and fused), regression/classification targets selectable from task metadata.

Activation patching between conditions (e.g., replace latent of “Go” with “NoGo”) and measure behavioral/decoding shift.

Head/block ablations with automated report ranking importance by drop in alignment/accuracy.

SAE features learned on fused latents; per-feature activation maps across time, input channels, and brain regions.

Model↔brain alignment pipelines: CCA/PLS/RSA with proper noise ceilings and bootstrap CIs.

Dynamical fingerprints: eigen-spectrum of linearized dynamics around trajectories, Lyapunov proxy, and manifold visualization (Isomap/UMAP) with temporal coloring.

Cross-domain “shared concept” mining: cluster SAE features that are causally important across tasks/species; label them via probe dictionaries.
