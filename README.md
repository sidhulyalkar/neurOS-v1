# neurOS-v1 ‚Äì A Modular Operating System for Brain‚ÄëComputer Interfaces

**neurOS-v1** is a reimagined version of the original neurOS codebase.  It focuses
on clarity, extensibility and measurable performance while delivering a
production‚Äëready platform for brain‚Äìcomputer interface (BCI) development and
research.  This repository contains a self‚Äëcontained Python package and
accompanying scripts for real‚Äëtime neural data streaming, processing and
classification.  It also includes benchmarking tools and a simple dashboard so
that researchers can evaluate the system end‚Äëto‚Äëend.

## Highlights

* **Streamlined drivers** ‚Äì A unified API for reading data from real or simulated
  BCI hardware.  Drivers can be hot‚Äëswapped without modifying the rest of the
  pipeline.
* **Pluggable processing pipeline** ‚Äì Filters, feature extractors and models
  live in their own modules and are loaded dynamically at run time.  New
  algorithms can be added without changing core code.
* **Agent‚Äëbased orchestration** ‚Äì An asynchronous orchestrator coordinates
  multiple agents (device, processing and model) to build a real‚Äëtime BCI
  pipeline.  Agents monitor performance and can adapt their behaviour when
  signals degrade.
* **Model training and inference** ‚Äì Built‚Äëin support for offline training and
  real‚Äëtime inference with state‚Äëof‚Äëthe‚Äëart neural and classical models.  Models
  implement a simple interface so that custom architectures can be added
  easily.
* **Benchmarking suite** ‚Äì Scripts to measure latency, throughput and accuracy
  using synthetic and recorded datasets.  Benchmarks facilitate fair
  comparisons with other BCI frameworks.
* **Dashboard and CLI** ‚Äì A lightweight Streamlit dashboard (optional) and
  command line interface make it easy to run pipelines, launch benchmarks and
  visualise data without writing code.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shulyalk/neuros-v1.git
cd neuros-v1
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# run basic diagnostics
neuros --help
```

### Running a Pipeline

You can run a real‚Äëtime pipeline with a simulated driver using the CLI:

```bash
# run a pipeline that streams data for 5 seconds
neuros run --duration 5
```

The pipeline will print classification outputs to the terminal and record
latency metrics.  See `neuros run --help` for all options.

### Benchmarking

To evaluate the system performance on synthetic data, run:

```bash
neuros benchmark --duration 10 --report benchmarks/report.json
```

This command measures throughput, end‚Äëto‚Äëend latency and classification
accuracy over a configurable duration.  The resulting report can be used to
compare neurOS with other systems.

### Dashboard

An optional Streamlit dashboard is provided for interactive monitoring.  To
launch it, install `streamlit` and run:

```bash
pip install streamlit
neuros dashboard

## Constellation Demo Pipeline

In addition to single‚Äëdevice pipelines, neurOS includes a **Constellation
demo** that ingests and synchronises multiple modalities (EEG, audio,
video, EDA, fNIRS/HD‚ÄëDOT, respiration, ECG and phone sensors), writes
raw data to NWB/Zarr (or fallbacks), exports curated samples into
WebDataset shards and optionally launches a distributed training job.
The demo exposes Prometheus metrics for observability and supports
fault injection to test robustness.

To run the demo locally for 10 seconds and store data in
`/tmp/constellation_demo`:

```bash
neuros constellation \
  --duration 10 \
  --output-dir /tmp/constellation_demo \
  --subject-id demo \
  --session-id session1 \
  --fault-injection
```

If you have a Kafka broker running on `localhost:9092`, events will be
published to topics prefixed with `raw`.  Use `--no-kafka` to disable
streaming and run in dry‚Äërun mode.  A helper script
`scripts/run_local_demo.py` simplifies launching the demo and
optionally starting the local Kafka stack via Docker Compose.

See `docs/runbook_constellation.md` for a detailed guide, including
instructions for starting Kafka with Docker Compose, importing the
preconfigured Grafana dashboard and running integration tests.
