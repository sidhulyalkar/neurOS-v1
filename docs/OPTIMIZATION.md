## Profiling & Measurement

### Built-in Profiling

Use the provided profiling script:

```bash
python scripts/profile_performance.py
```

**Output includes:**
- Feature extraction latency by channel count
- Filtering latency (bandpass, smoothing)
- Model prediction latency by type and batch size
- Complete pipeline throughput and latency

### Results Interpretation

Example output:
```
Feature Extraction (4 channels, 250 samples):
  Avg time: 0.42ms ± 0.14ms

Filtering (4 channels, 250 samples):
  Bandpass: 0.018ms
  Smoothing: 0.017ms
  Total: 0.035ms

Model Prediction (single sample):
  SimpleClassifier: 0.028ms
  SVMModel: 0.038ms
  RandomForest: 0.791ms
```

**Analysis:**
- Feature extraction is the bottleneck (0.42ms vs 0.035ms for filtering)
- Simple models are 20-30x faster than Random Forest
- Filtering is already highly optimized

---

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Use Optimized Modules

Replace standard modules with optimized versions:

```python
# Standard (slower)
from neuros.processing.feature_extraction import BandPowerExtractor

# Optimized (10-30% faster)
from neuros.processing.feature_extraction_optimized import OptimizedBandPowerExtractor

# With caching (2-4x faster on repeated data)
from neuros.processing.feature_extraction_optimized import CachedBandPowerExtractor
```

**Speedup:** 10-30% for standard optimization, 2-4x with caching

### 2. Use Streaming Architectures

For real-time applications, use streaming components:

```python
from neuros.processing.streaming import (
    RingBuffer,
    StreamingFilter,
    LowLatencyPipeline
)

# Create streaming pipeline
pipeline = LowLatencyPipeline(
    buffer_size=1000,
    n_channels=8,
    filters=[streaming_filter],
    feature_extractor=streaming_extractor
)

# Process samples as they arrive
features = pipeline.process_sample(new_data)
```

**Benefits:**
- O(1) buffer operations
- Stateful filtering (no recomputation)
- Minimal memory allocation
- Sub-5ms latency achievable

### 3. Reduce Feature Dimensionality

Fewer features = faster processing:

```python
# High dimensionality (slower)
bands = {
    'delta': (1, 4),
    'theta': (4, 8),
    'low_alpha': (8, 10),
    'high_alpha': (10, 13),
    'low_beta': (13, 20),
    'high_beta': (20, 30),
    'gamma': (30, 50)
}
# 8 channels × 7 bands = 56 features

# Optimal (faster)
bands = {
    'alpha': (8, 13),
    'beta': (13, 30),
    'gamma': (30, 50)
}
# 8 channels × 3 bands = 24 features
```

**Speedup:** ~2x for feature extraction, ~3x for model prediction

### 4. Choose Appropriate Models

Model complexity vs speed trade-off:

```python
# Fastest (0.03ms/sample) - 75-80% accuracy
model = SimpleClassifier()

# Fast (0.08ms/sample) - 80-85% accuracy
model = SVMModel()

# Medium (0.3ms/sample) - 82-87% accuracy
model = RandomForestModel(n_estimators=20)

# Slow (0.8ms/sample) - 85-90% accuracy
model = RandomForestModel(n_estimators=100)
```

**Recommendation:** Start with SVMModel for best speed/accuracy trade-off.

### 5. Use float32 Instead of float64

Reduces memory and computation:

```python
# Standard precision
data = np.array(samples, dtype=np.float64)  # 8 bytes per value

# Reduced precision (sufficient for BCI)
data = np.array(samples, dtype=np.float32)  # 4 bytes per value
```

**Benefits:**
- 2x memory reduction
- 10-20% faster computations (CPU cache efficiency)
- No accuracy loss for BCI applications

### 6. Batch Processing

Process multiple samples together:

```python
# Slow: Process one at a time
for sample in samples:
    features = extractor.extract(sample)
    prediction = model.predict(features)

# Fast: Batch processing
features_batch = extractor.extract_batch(samples)
predictions = model.predict(features_batch)
```

**Speedup:** 3-5x for batch sizes of 10-50

### 7. Parallel Processing

For multi-core systems:

```python
from neuros.processing.filters_optimized import BatchFilterProcessor

processor = BatchFilterProcessor(filters)
filtered = processor.process_batch_parallel(data_batch, n_jobs=-1)
```

**Speedup:** Up to N/2 on N-core systems (with overhead)

## Component-Specific Optimizations

### Feature Extraction

**Bottleneck:** Welch's PSD computation (FFT-based)

**Optimizations:**

1. **Pre-compute frequency indices:**
```python
# Optimized version pre-computes and caches frequency indices
extractor = OptimizedBandPowerExtractor(fs=250.0)
# First call: computes indices
features1 = extractor.extract(data1)
# Subsequent calls: reuses indices (faster)
features2 = extractor.extract(data2)
```

2. **Reduce nperseg parameter:**
```python
# Higher resolution (slower): nperseg=256
extractor = BandPowerExtractor(fs=250.0)

# Lower resolution (faster, sufficient for most BCI):
extractor = OptimizedBandPowerExtractor(fs=250.0, nperseg=128)
```

**Speedup:** ~30% with nperseg=128

3. **Use vectorized operations:**
```python
from neuros.processing.feature_extraction_optimized import VectorizedFeatureExtractor

extractor = VectorizedFeatureExtractor(fs=250.0)
features = extractor.extract_statistical_features(data)
```

**Speedup:** 2-3x for statistical features vs PSD

### Filtering

Already highly optimized, but further improvements:

1. **Use SOS (Second-Order Sections):**
```python
from neuros.processing.filters_optimized import OptimizedBandpassFilter

# More stable and faster than standard form
filt = OptimizedBandpassFilter(8.0, 30.0, fs=250.0)
```

**Benefits:**
- Better numerical stability
- 5-10% faster than IIR form
- Reduced filter artifacts

2. **Streaming filters for online processing:**
```python
from neuros.processing.streaming import StreamingFilter

# Maintains state between calls (no warm-up needed)
stream_filt = StreamingFilter(b, a, n_channels=8)

# Process samples as they arrive
for new_sample in data_stream:
    filtered = stream_filt.process(new_sample)
```

**Benefits:**
- No startup transients
- Minimal latency
- Constant memory usage

### Spatial Filtering (CSP)

CSP is computationally efficient but can be optimized:

1. **Reduce components:**
```python
# More components (slower)
csp = CommonSpatialPatterns(n_components=8)

# Optimal for most tasks (faster)
csp = CommonSpatialPatterns(n_components=4)
```

**Speedup:** Linear in n_components

2. **Pre-compute filters:**
```python
# Fit once
csp.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Transform many times (fast)
for X_test in test_batches:
    features = csp.transform(X_test)
```

### Model Inference

1. **Batch predictions:**
```python
# Slow
predictions = [model.predict(x) for x in X_test]

# Fast
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

**Speedup:** 5-10x

2. **Probability vs class predictions:**
```python
# Faster (just returns class)
classes = model.predict(X)

# Slower (computes probabilities first)
probs = model.predict_proba(X)
classes = np.argmax(probs, axis=1)
```

**Speedup:** 20-30% by avoiding probability computation

## Real-Time Considerations

### Latency Budget

For a 50ms total latency target:

| Component | Budget | Actual | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| Data acquisition | 4ms | 4ms | ✅ |
| Buffering | 1ms | 0.2ms | ✅ |
| Filtering | 2ms | 0.04ms | ✅ |
| Feature extraction | 20ms | 0.4-3ms | ✅ |
| Model prediction | 10ms | 0.03-5ms | ✅ |
| Output/control | 5ms | 2ms | ✅ |
| **Margin** | 8ms | 40-47ms | ✅ |

neurOS comfortably meets 50ms targets with substantial margin.

### Jitter Reduction

Minimize variance in latency:

1. **Use fixed-size buffers:**
```python
# Variable allocation (high jitter)
buffer = []
buffer.append(data)

# Fixed allocation (low jitter)
buffer = RingBuffer(capacity=1000, n_channels=8)
buffer.append(data)
```

2. **Preallocate arrays:**
```python
# Allocates on each call (jitter)
def process(data):
    result = np.zeros(len(data))
    # ...

# Preallocated (consistent)
class Processor:
    def __init__(self, max_size):
        self._buffer = np.zeros(max_size)

    def process(self, data):
        self._buffer[:len(data)] = data
        # ...
```

3. **Monitor latency distribution:**
```python
stats = pipeline.get_performance_stats()
print(f"P95 latency: {stats['p95_latency_ms']:.2f}ms")
print(f"P99 latency: {stats['p99_latency_ms']:.2f}ms")
```

**Target:** P99 latency < 2× mean latency

## Advanced Techniques

### Zero-Copy Operations

Avoid unnecessary data copies:

```python
# Copies data (slow)
filtered = filter.apply(data.copy())

# In-place operation (fast, if supported)
filter.apply_inplace(data)

# View without copy (fastest)
window = buffer.get_view(250)  # No copy
```

### Memory-Mapped Arrays

For large datasets:

```python
# Load entire array into memory
data = np.load('large_dataset.npy')

# Memory-mapped (lazy loading)
data = np.load('large_dataset.npy', mmap_mode='r')
```

### JIT Compilation

For custom feature extractors:

```python
from numba import jit

@jit(nopython=True)
def custom_feature(data):
    # Your feature extraction code
    return features

# First call compiles, subsequent calls are fast
```

**Speedup:** 10-100x for numerical Python code

## Troubleshooting Performance

### Symptom: High Latency

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
python scripts/profile_performance.py
```

**Solutions:**
1. If feature extraction is slow:
   - Use `OptimizedBandPowerExtractor`
   - Reduce frequency bands
   - Use smaller nperseg

2. If model prediction is slow:
   - Use simpler model
   - Reduce features
   - Use batch predictions

3. If filtering is slow (rare):
   - Reduce filter order
   - Use SOS form
   - Check data is contiguous

### Symptom: High Jitter

**Diagnosis:**
```python
stats = pipeline.get_performance_stats()
jitter = stats['p99_latency_ms'] / stats['mean_latency_ms']
print(f"Jitter ratio: {jitter:.2f}")  # Should be < 2.0
```

**Solutions:**
- Preallocate all buffers
- Use fixed-size arrays
- Avoid dynamic memory allocation
- Disable garbage collection during critical sections

### Symptom: Memory Leaks

**Diagnosis:**
```python
import tracemalloc
tracemalloc.start()
# Run your code
snapshot = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()
top_stats = snapshot.statistics('lineno')
for stat in top_stats[:10]:
    print(stat)
```

**Solutions:**
- Clear buffers explicitly
- Use context managers
- Avoid circular references
- Call `.clear()` on ring buffers periodically
